## Welcome to Astro

This is the Astro Design System template. You can customize it however you want.

This template uses tailwind, which in itself is highly customizable if you want to give it your brand look & feel.

### Adding new sections

To add a new section, create an astro or markdown file in the `src/pages/en/` directory.

### Customizing the defaults

If you want to customize the default colors, typography or shadows you can find the configuration file at `src/config/design.config.ts`.

### Adding your components

Astro is great for design systems because it allows you to import components from different frameworks like react, vue or svelte.

### Have fun!
