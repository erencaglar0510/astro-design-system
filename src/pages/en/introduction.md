## Welcome to Astro

This is the Astro Design System template. You can customize it however you want.

This template uses tailwind, which in itself is highly customizable if you want to give it your brand's look & feel.

### Adding new sections

To add a new section, create an astro or markdown file in the `src/pages/[lang]/` directory.

### Customizing defaults (colors, typography, shadows...)

If you want to customize the default colors, typography or shadows you can find the configuration file at `src/config/design.config.ts`.

### Customizing the page layout

You can find the css for the pages in `src/styles/content.scss`.

### Adding your components

Astro is great for design systems because it allows you to import components from different frameworks like react, vue or svelte.

To get started check how the `MainButton` component is used in the `src/pages/en/buttons.md` file.

You can import your component library or create your own and document it easily.
